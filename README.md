# important server notice
I'm currently testing methods to prevent malicious traffic to my server (including badbots, known malware ips, cdpr takedown bots, etc).
This might negatively impact performance and/or user experience on my Invidious instance until I figured out the correct settings.
If you experience any problems, please open an issue providing detailed informations on what you did and what happened.
Thank you!
