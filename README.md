# important server notice
I'm currently testing methods to prevent malicious traffic to my server (including badbots, known malware ips, request floods, video-crawling, etc).
This might negatively impact performance and/or user experience on my Invidious instance until I figured out the correct settings.
If you experience any problems, please open an issue providing detailed informations on what you did and what happened.
And please try to reproduce the problem at least 2 times to verify it was not a temporary problem.
Thank you!
