# important server notice
I'm currently testing methods to prevent malicious traffic to my server (including badbots, known malware ips, request floods, video-crawling, etc).


This might negatively impact performance and/or user experience on my Invidious instance until I figured out the correct settings.
If you experience any problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Sommerwiesel/invidious/issues/new?assignees=Sommerwiesel&labels=lockout&template=lockout-report.md&title=%5BLOCK-REPORT%5D+%3A+%3CTITLE%3E) providing detailed informations on what you did and what happened.

And please try to reproduce the problem at least 2 times during a 10min period to verify it was not a temporary problem.


Thank you!
